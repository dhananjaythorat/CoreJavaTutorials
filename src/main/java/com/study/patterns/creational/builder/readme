Intent : Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. . 
 

Pattern Benefits:
		
			1)  The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object 
			    using the same construction code. 
			
			2) Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescopic constructor”.
			
			3) Use the Builder pattern when some of the parameters might be optional.
