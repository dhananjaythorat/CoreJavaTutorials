Intent : 	Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes 
			and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
			
Pattern Benefits:
		
			1) This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class 
			   from client program to the factory class.
				
			2) Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types 
			   and dependencies of the objects your code should work with..
