Intent : Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, 
		 while providing a global access point to this instance.
			
Pattern Benefits:
		
			1) Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients.
			
			2) Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.
