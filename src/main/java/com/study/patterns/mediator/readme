Intent : Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies 
		 between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects 
		 and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.	 
			
Pattern Benefits:

	1) Use the Mediator pattern when it’s hard to change some of the classes because 
	   they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other classes.
	   
	2) Use the pattern when you can’t reuse a component in a different program 
		because it’s too dependent on other components.
