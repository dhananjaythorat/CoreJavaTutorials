Intent : 	Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to 
			notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they’re observing.
			

Applicability :
 	1)	Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, 
 		all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
 		
 	2)	Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing 
 		other objects, and the actual set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
 		
 	3)  Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, 
 		but only for a limited time or in specific cases.
