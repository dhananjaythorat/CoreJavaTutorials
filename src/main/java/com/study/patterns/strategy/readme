Intent : 	Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, 
			put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
			

Applicability :
 	1)	Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object 
 		and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
 		
 	2)	Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between 
 		different variants of the same algorithm.
