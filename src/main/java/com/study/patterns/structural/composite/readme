Intent : Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and 
		 then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
			
Pattern Benefits:
		
			1) Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.
			
			2) When we need to create a structure in a way that the objects in the structure has to be treated the same way.
