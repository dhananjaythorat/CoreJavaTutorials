Intent : 	Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface 
			to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.
			
Pattern Benefits:
		
			1) Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but 
				straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
				
			2) Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
