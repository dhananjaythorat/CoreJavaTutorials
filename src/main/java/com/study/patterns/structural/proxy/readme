Intent : 	Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. 

			
Pattern Benefits:
		
			1)  This is used when we want to provide controlled access of a functionality.
				
			2) A proxy controls access to the original object,  allowing you to perform something 
			   either before or after the request gets through to the original object..
