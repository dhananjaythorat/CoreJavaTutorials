Intent : 	Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of 
			an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of 
			the algorithm without changing its structure.
			
Pattern Benefits:

	1) to implement the invariant parts of an algorithm once and leave it 
		up to subclasses to implement the behavior that can vary.

	2) Use the pattern when you have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms 
		with some minor differences. As a result, you might need to modify all classes 
		when the algorithm changes.
